# Orange vs Grapefruit: Binary Classification with Neural Networks

## Overview
This project focuses on building a binary classification model to distinguish between oranges and grapefruits using neural networks. It walks through key machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing, model training, and inference.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains key characteristics of oranges and grapefruits, making it suitable for a classification task. The dataset is available at:
- [Kaggle: Orange vs Grapefruit](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joshmcadams/oranges-vs-grapefruit)

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions.
   - Normalize and split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Implement a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Define model architecture, including input layers, hidden layers, and activation functions.
   - Train the model using an appropriate loss function and optimizer.

3. **Evaluation & Inference:**
   - Assess the model's performance using accuracy and loss metrics.
   - Conduct inference to classify new fruit samples based on trained features.

## Results & Conclusion
The final trained model effectively classifies oranges and grapefruits based on their characteristics. This project demonstrates the essential steps in developing a binary classification neural network and reinforces fundamental deep-learning concepts.
